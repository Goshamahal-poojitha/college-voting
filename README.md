# College Voting System

The **College Voting System** is a simple web-based project developed as part of an RRP (Real-Time Research  Project) to automate student elections in a college. This system ensures a smooth, transparent, and efficient voting process using a clean user interface and basic web technologies.

## Features

*  Student entry form with name and roll number input
*  Candidate listing with radio-button voting selection
*  One-click voting submission
*  Result page showing percentage-based outcomes for each candidate
*  Custom-styled UI with background images and responsive design

##  Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3
* **Navigation/Flow**: Static HTML form navigation (`action` and `onclick` redirections)
* **Deployment**: Can be run locally on any browser (no server required)

##  Project Structure

* `student_details.html` – Collects student information before voting
* `participant_list.html` – Displays candidates and allows vote selection
* `result.html` – Shows the voting result (sample percentages hardcoded for now)
